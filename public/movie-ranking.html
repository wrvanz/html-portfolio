<h3>Dead Poets society</h3>
<p>Maverick teacher John Keating returns in 1959 to the prestigious New England boys' boarding school where he was once a star student, using poetry to embolden his pupils to new heights of self-expression.</p>

<h3>A Christmas Story</h3>
<p>This one is a classic. The film is about a boy named Ralphie Parker who wishes for an official Red Ryder Carbine-action 200-shot Range Model Air Rifle for Christmas. He tries to get this BB gun while getting through childhood problems like two menacing bullies, a protective mother, grumpy father, a whiny younger brother, and a mean Santa Claus.</p>

<h3>Eat Pray Love</h3>
<p>This is an adaptation of a book written by Elizabeth Gilbert. The story is about a woman's journey of self-discovery through her travels to Italy, India and Indonesia. It's light hearted but reflective.</p>
